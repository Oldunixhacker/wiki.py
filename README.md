## Install

> **Warning**: `pip` must be installed to install Wiki.py.
`pip` is used to install neccesary dependencies and the installer largely depends on it.
SQLite is also required, so the server can store the wiki pages.

1. Go to your server folder, or create a new one
2. Run the following command:
   ```shell
   python3 -c '$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylerMS887/wiki.py/main/install.py)'
   ```
3. Go through each step
4. Exit the installer, and run the following command:
   ```shell
   python3 wiki.py
   ```
